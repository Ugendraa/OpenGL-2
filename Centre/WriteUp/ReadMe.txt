Steps to execute the program:
    •Click on the build option located on the menu bar and select the build solution to compile the code or just use the function key (f7).
    •Remove the errors if any and recompile.
    •Run the program once the compilation is successful by clicking on the green button present in menu bar or just use the function key (f5).
    •Now you can find a new window waiting for the users input.Right click on the window titles "My Window" for options.
    •First select the "read cost matrix" option. Go to the C window and enter the number of nodes and the cost matrix.
    •Now click on "My window" input area.Each left click places a node in that position. The source vertex is identified by a different color to those of the other vertices.
    •Now select the option "Display weighted graph" which displays the edges along with the costs between the vertices.The edge directions are color coded.
     Green edge indicates an edge from lower numbered vertex to a higher numbered while an orange edge indicates the direction in the other way.
    •Finally select the "Display shortest path" option that display shortest path from source to all other vertices.
    •Select the "Exit" option to exit the windows.
